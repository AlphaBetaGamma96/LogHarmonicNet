# Solving the Harmonic Oscillator Hamiltonian in 1D with Artifical Neural Networks

This Github repo uses Artifical Neural Networks (ANNs) as the ansatz for 
the wavefunction of a Quantum Mechnical Hamiltonian and solves for the ground-state
of said system via use of the Rayleight-Ritz Variational Principle and 
Quantum Monte Carlo techniques.
